### Describe the problem you'd like to see solved or task you'd like to see made easier

<!--- What steps or tasks are you trying to complete along the way? -->

### Is this in relation to an existing part of se-icon or something new?

<!--- If so, what part of SE Icons? -->

### What is 1 thing that we can do when building this feature that will guarantee that it is awesome?

<!--- e.g. make finding icons while I'm designing super fast  -->

### Why would other SE Icons users care about this?

<!--- e.g. because everyone wants icons that fly  -->

### On a scale of 1 (sometime in the future) to 10 (absolutely right now), how soon would you recommend we make this feature?

<!--- e.g. 5 - "while we're young" -->

### Feature request checklist

- [x] I did my best to complete the feature request
- [ ] This is a single feature (i.e. not a re-write of all of Font Awesome)
- [ ] The title starts with "Feature request: " and is followed by a clear feature name (Ex: `Feature request: moar cowbell`)
- [ ] I have [searched for existing issues](https://github.schneider-electric.com/IoT/se-icons/issues) and to the best of my knowledge this is not a duplicate
