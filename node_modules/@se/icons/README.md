# Schneider-Electric icons library

This small library let you import all SE icons as font to make them easier to manipulate in your application like:

- Increase/decrease size
- Add color
- Add css animation ...

You can find all information on how to install the font from the [Quartz Design System](https://pages.github.schneider-electric.com/iot/design-system/resources/websites/icon-font)

## Overview

The list of the icons can be find here.

Only the `SASS` and `CSS` version is currently available. If `LESS` support is needed, please create an Issue or a pull request if you want to contribute.


## Version control best practices

Best practices to stay in the same version (backward compatible between same X.y.y):

- An icon should not be renamed. This will make sure that we don't break existing icon.
- An updated icon that keeps the same meaning can be updated with the same name.
- An icon cannot be updated if it changes the meaning of the icon. A new icon with a different name should be created instead.

Version updates and acknowledgments:

- Updating an icon name or removing an icon should be considered as a breaking change so the version should move from 2.x.x to 3.x.x since we follow semver best practices.
- All version 3.x.x should be backward compatible with other previous 3.y.y versions.
- Icons in version 4.x.x may or may not be backward compatible with version 3.x.x.


## Getting started

### Use it on your desktop

Schneider-electric icons can be used on the desktop. Add icons to your design mockups, presentations, and elsewhere.
We’ve tried to make it super easy with our new ligature-based font files. And for the times where you need more, we’ve included polished vector SVG versions of each icon separately.

**What to download**
Our Desktop-focused download contains the following directories and files:

| Folders & files      | What They Are                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/fonts/se-icon.ttf` | Font file compatible with every operating system                                |
| `/svg/`              | Individual optimized .svg vector files for each icon in SE (separated by style) |

You can use SE Font Icons by typing the name of your icon as a plain text, then changing the familly font to "se-icon". You can read more about it in the following post: [fontawesome ligature](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/referencing-icons/using-ligatures).

### Use it as a web developer

**Configure environment**

To configure your local environment, please refer to the [Design System setup documentation](https://pages.github.schneider-electric.com/iot/design-system/framework/framework-integration/setup)


**Install dependencies:**

```
npm install --save @se/icons
```

- Using `SCSS`
  **Add references in your own `theme.scss` file:**

  ```scss
  $se-icon-folder: "~@se/icons/fonts";
  @import "~@se/icons/scss/styles.scss";

  ```
  **Customize your own classes**

  access material variable with Sass mixins:

  ```scss
  .my-face {
    @include se-icon('man');
  }
  # or
  .my-face:before {
    content: se-icons-content('man');
  }
  ```

- Using `CSS`
  **Add references in your own `styles.css` file:**

  You can download the latest `css/` folder and `fonts/` folder from this repository, then reference is in your HTML. 

  ```html
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css">
  </head>
  ```

## Usage

As ligature:

```html
<i class="se-icon">name</i>
```

As class (will be deprecated soon, prefer using ligature):

```html
<i class="se-icon-name"></i>
```

**PS :** If you only use ligature in your app, add `$se-generate-font-class: "false"` in your `them-variables.scss` file. This will save up to 70Kb of unused classes.


### Working with Ionic 4.x.x

To use the Icons with Ionic 4 & Angular 2+ you need to add the `svg folder` to the assets array inside your angular.json like this:

```json 
  "assets": [
    "src/favicon.ico",
    "src/assets",
    { // Ionicons
      "glob": "**/*.svg",
      "input": "node_modules/ionicons/dist/ionicons/svg",
      "output": "./svg"
    },
    { // Se-Icons
      "glob": "**/*.svg",
      "input": "node_modules/@se/icons/ionic",
      "output": "./svg"
    }
 ```

 Now you can use the se-icons the same way you can use the ionicons. There is no need for an se- prefix anymore:

```html
   <ion-button>
    Ionicons
    <ion-icon slot="end" name="star"></ion-icon> // ionicon
  </ion-button>
  <ion-button>
    SE-ICONS CLass
    <ion-icon slot="end" name="bowtie"></ion-icon> // used to be se-icon-bowtie
  </ion-button>
```

### Working with Ionic 3.x.x

If you want to use any of the icon in the the tab bar of ionic, you will need to add ionic class extension. To reduce the size of the css font bundle, we decided to remove it by default. When using the scss form, you can simply re-activate it by updating your `theme-variables.scss` file:

```scss
$se-generate-ionic-font-class: "true";
```
