Rollup + Snowpack + Svelte
==========================

This is a Svelte App. It doesn't use Sapper, neither doesn't it support Server Side Rendering.

Page.js is used as a router. See App.svelte for configuration.

TailwindCSS is used. Useless classes are removed at compile time in production.

Web Modules
-----------

They are generated by snowpack into /src/web_modules every time you install or add a npm module.
This way is preferred so that you are sure you are using ES6 modules and that tree-shaking is easy and efficient.
It may also show you how many external modules you are using and the impact they have for the final bundle size.

WASM Modules
------------

They are modules generated by "wasm-pack build --target web" if you are using Rust.
But it can be any wasm modules you need.

- Copy the JavaScript file into the /src/wasm_modules folder.
- Copy the WASM file into /public/wasm

Call init(), from the generated wasm_module, with the absolute path like "/wasm/[your module name].wasm"

Workers
-------

Workers need to be configured and declared into "rollup.config.js" and compiled as an iife.
It allows to use ES modules instead of using "importScript()" and they will be minified for production.
The only disadvantage is that each worker will have the same imported modules into them.
